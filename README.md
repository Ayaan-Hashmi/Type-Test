# Type Test - Ayaan Hashmi

## Overview

This is a straightforward terminal-based program developed by **Ayaan Hashmi** that evaluates typing speed and accuracy. The program randomly selects a sentence from a set of predefined options for the user to type. Additionally, it includes a custom mode where users can input their own sentence for a personalized typing test. After the user types the sentence, the program calculates both the words per minute (WPM) and accuracy based on any typing errors.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Ayaan-Hashmi/Type-Test.git
   cd type-test
   ```

2. **Run the program:**
   ```
   python type-test.py
   ```

### Features:
- Typing Speed Calculation (words per minute)
- Accuracy Calculation (based on typing errors)
- Randomly selected predefined sentences
- Custom mode for user-defined sentences

### Ongoing Development:
I am currently working on several enhancements for this program. Future updates will include fetching sentences dynamically from the internet, allowing users to input and save their own sentences, and adding various practice modes. Additionally, a graphical user interface (GUI) and sound effects are in development to enhance user interaction and feedback.

### Current State:
The program currently runs in the terminal, displaying typing speed and accuracy results after the user completes the test.
